# KMeans
KMeans Algorithm on Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset
KMeans Clustering Algorithm is an unsupervised ML technique used for grouping similar data points into clusters. 
It has various applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and more. 
In the attached jupyter notebook, I have implemented KMeans algo on mall customer dataset to 
understand the customers like who can be easily converge Target Customers.
